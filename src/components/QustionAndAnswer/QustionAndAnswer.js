                <h1>How does react work?</h1>
                <p>  <strong>Ans:</strong> While building client-side apps, a team of Facebook developers realized that the DOM is slow (The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.). So, to make it faster, React implements a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript. So when it needs to read or write to the DOM, it will use the virtual representation of it. Then the virtual DOM will try to find the most efficient way to update the browser’s DOM.
Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements. The reason for this is that JavaScript is very fast and it’s worth keeping a DOM tree in it to speed up its manipulation.
Although React was conceived to be used in the browser, because of its design it can also be used in the server with Node.js. </p>

                <h1>What are Difference between props and state?</h1>
                <p><strong>Ans: </strong> <strong>State</strong> <br />
The state is an updatable structure that is used to contain data or information about the component and can change over time. The change in state can happen as a response to user action or system event. It is the heart of the react component which determines the behavior of the component and how it will render. A state must be kept as simple as possible. It represents the component's local state or information. It can only be accessed or modified inside the component or by the component <br />

<strong>Props</strong> <br />
Props are read-only components. It is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes. It allows passing data from one component to other components. It is similar to function arguments and can be passed to the component the same way as arguments passed in a function. Props are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component.</p>

                <h1>what are the Use effect useages expect data load</h1>
                <p><strong>Ans </strong>:The motivation behind the introduction of useEffect Hook is to eliminate the side-effects of using class-based components. For example, tasks like updating the DOM, fetching data from API end-points, setting up subscriptions or timers, etc can be lead to unwarranted side-effects. Since the render method is to quick to produce a side-effect one needs to use life cycle methods to observe the side effects. For example, consider updating the document title for a simple counter component to the current value. On the initial render, we set the current clicked value to 0 clicks. So, this section is coded into the componentDidMount() method which is executed only once in the component life cycle. Then we create a button to increment the count state value by one on every click. As the count value state changes, we also need to update the document title again and for that, we need to write the same piece of code in componentDidUpdate(). The componentDidupdate() method is perfect for updating the counter value at any time the state changes but the repetition of code is one of the side-effects.</p>
